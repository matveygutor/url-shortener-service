# url-shortener-service
This small project provides a service for creating short links of a fixed length.

All you need to do is simply click the “Create” button, enter your link in the input field and receive a short link that will redirect you to the original address.

The main advantage of this project is that you no longer need to search and remember long and unreadable links.

You can store them in abbreviated form, give them a name and add a description.

There is also a mechanism for counting clicks on a short link.

The project was implemented using ASP.NET
